when declaring the object of type struct:
-----------------------------------------
   1. you don't have to use new.
   2. if you have a field inside struct, you must initialize with object.
   3. if you don't want to initialize the field use [new] keyword, then it will give the default value of int which is 0.

**look at mutable and immutable again**

you can make readonly struct, and all instances inside must be readonly
the class doesn't have this feature.

DateTime is a struct.

All value data types are structs.

when you type:

int x = 4;
x = x + 1;  // this is not the same x, it is another location in the memory

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
struct: 
-------
don't support destructor.
don't support inheritance.
don't recommended for large data.
can't use anything inside struct without initializing all fields.
