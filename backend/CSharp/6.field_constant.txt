→ access modifiers for class are → internal and public

→ default access modifier of class is (internal).

→ object is called instance for the class

→ to call a const must be called by class name.

→ You can call fields with object but constants mut use class name.

→ Class is reference type, The object saved in stack and the value saved in heap.

→ You can make array of class type
  example:
  ---------
  Employee[] arr = new Employee[10]; // making array of 1
  objects
  Employee e1 = new Employee();
  e1.name = "ahmed";
  e1.age = 26;
  e1 = arr[0];
  // and so on..
