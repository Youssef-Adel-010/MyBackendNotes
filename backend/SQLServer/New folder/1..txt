→ Database Normalization → is the process of organizing data in a database, This includes creating tables and establishing relationships between those tables according
  to rules designed both to protect the data and to make the database more flexible by eliminating redundancy and inconsistent dependency.


→ first to make nirmalization form is setting the primary key.


→ how to set the primary key?
  1- super key → all compinations = ( 2^n - 1 ) 
  2- candidate key → proper subset od the super key
  3- primary key → one of the primary keys its value != null


→ row = record = tuple
→ column = attribute = field

→ Every attribute of the candidate key is called → prime attribute
→ Every attribute not in the candidate key is called → non-prime attribute
→ All keys remaining after choosing the primary key is called → alternate key
→ foregin key → is a key its values is subset of the primary key

1st Normal Form (1nf):
----------------------
1- Relation must have primary key
2- Domain value preserved → means that each column has the same domain (all are nums, or chars, or emails, or phones....)
3- Every column have atomic value → means that it can't be devided into more columns (look at the 1st normal photo).

→ how can you make the column atomic? 
 you can decompose the column, instead of one you can make 3 columns
 but you will have alot of null, editing the desing isn't easy and when you search you will search in 3 columns.

→ so we will make a new table of foregin keys and the devided column.

→ composite key → combination of multiple columns.
